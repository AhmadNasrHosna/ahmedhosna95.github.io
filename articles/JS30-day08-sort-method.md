Today I learned about the array method: sort().

``` javascript
Array.prototype.sort();
```
 
STARTER POINT:

``` javascript
const bandNames = [
  "The Devil Wears Prada",
  "Anywehre But Here",
  "An Old Dog",
  "Pierce The Viel",
  "Norma Jean",
  "A Skylit Drive",
  "Counterparts",
  "The Plot On You",
  "The Midway State",
  "Say Anything",
  "The Bled",
  "We Came As Romans"
];
```


### 1/ .some()
.some() method is - at least - looking for one item from the array items:

â™¦ Is at least one person 19?
